# CFG-SQL-Project
I created this project as my individual submission on the Code First Girls 8 week Intro to Data & SQL Course.

QUICK SUMMARY
-- FitLife is an imaginary local gym run on the concept of low fees to encourage everyone to lead a healthy life. 
-- Members receive a cumulative 3% discount for each week where they attend the gym at least 3 times
-- There is a special 20% discount (instead of 12% for 4 weeks) for attending at least 3 times every week for 4 weeks
-- the concept is being trialled and there is also a small number of classes run by experienced coaches at peak hours

-- Rules:
	-- 1) A session is defined as at least 45min elapsed between checking in and checking out
	-- 2) Only one session per day counts towards the discount
    -- 3) Because of the 4 weekly incentive, payment is taken via Direct Debit every 4 weeks (not every calendar month)
    -- 4) The discount resets to zero every 4 weeks and the member has to 'earn' their discount again for the next cycle
